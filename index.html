						Cira Canelas holds a Master's degree in Clinical Psychology from University of Belgrano, Argentina, and a License in Clinical Counseling. She has over 29 years of clinical experience.
						<br/><br/>

						Throughout her extensive years of experience and major professional certifications, she has a unique and solid therapeutic approach that combines deep psychodynamic analysis with somatic awareness and mindfulness techniques. 
						<br/><br/>
						Cira is trained in Hakomi (mindful somatic psychotherapy) and EMDR. She holds a teacher certificate in Mindfulness and Meditation (with Tara Brach and Jack Kornfield).  Cira has  also completed two years of clinical training on Object Relations Theory and Practice at the International Psychotherapy Institute in the Washington DC area.

						She is currently advancing a certification as a Holotropic Grof Breathwork facilitator (with the Grof Legacy Training) and as a Psychedelic Psychotherapist (with the Psychedelic Somatic Institute). 
						<br/><br/>
						An eternal student of life, her passion is to combine the many different approaches to the human psyche into her own personal psychotherapeutic approach.  She specializes in complex and developmental trauma, anxiety, and depression. She strongly believes in the potential of crisis as a gateway for growth and self-realization.

		<p style="font-size: 16px;">
			I am a clinical psychologist with a specialty in depth psychology and psychoanalysis.  In my personal life, I found myself in the Amazon where I learned from the natural world and from shamans and discovered deeper states of being and healing. 
			<br><br>
			My passion in spiritual approaches to psychotherapy brought me to incorporate a variety of different methods that touch on the spiritual realm of our psyche. I am certified in Hakomi, Mindfulness and Meditation, Object Relations Psychoanalysis, and EMDR. I am currently studying Holotropic Grof Breathwork and Psychedelic Therapy. 
			<br><br>
			I believe each of us has an innate wisdom and capacity for self-realization.  With trust in these inner resources, I aim to help you connect with your own gifts and healing potential.  Like a midwife, I facilitate this birthright. 
			<br><br>
			My thirty years of professional training are grounded in my capacity to sit with my clients with what is present in the here and now, and intuitively access your deep reservoir of resilience and healing. 
			<br><br>
			Our work is to weave a safe environment and work with all that is within. In a space of emotional safety and companionship, we sit with hurt and trauma until the storm passes and clarity arises, and we open the way for healing, growth, and transformation.  We work with the invisible and visible threads of the experiences that forms the tapestry of your life. 
			<br><br>
			I invite you to sit together in the space of your deeper self and connect with your own unfolding.
